Maya-Flipbook
=============

A python tool to easily create flipbook animations for maya using the pencil tool.

I'm just getting the project setup on github, doing a bit of a spring clean on it and also extending it for use with PyQt
as well as the native Maya UI.

I'll provide full documentation of the tool and link to examples and tutorials of its use in the near future.

Thanks,
Eoghan
